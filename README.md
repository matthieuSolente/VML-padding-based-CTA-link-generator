# vml-button-generator
The first Dynamic and Flexible padding based VML Triangle Generator !


This generator provides the html and vml code needed to create rounded buttons on all email clients. The particularity of this generator is that it takes into account color contrast for better accessibility, and above all, it is the only vml button generator to be based solely on padding. Here we are based on the visual rendering rather than on a fixed size and height. It is also possible to add a border, bold or uppercase text. The generator is limited to the only code necessary to create the button, instructs the integrator to insert it correctly in his email at the level of a cell or a div.
